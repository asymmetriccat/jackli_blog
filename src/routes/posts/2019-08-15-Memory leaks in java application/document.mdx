##  Memory leaks in java application:

** Introduction:**

Recently I am refreshing my java knowledge. There is an interesting topic about memory leaks. I met memory leaks a few times but didn't dig it in to find what happen.
Today I read some <a href = "https://stackify.com/memory-leaks-java/">blogs </a> and books. Below is the summarize what's happened with memory leaks,
and how to prevent it from our best.

**1. what is memory leaks in java?**

The standard definition of a memory leak is a scenario that occurs when objects are no longer being used by the application,
but the Garbage Collector is unable to remove them from working memory – because they’re still being referenced. As a result,
the application consumes more and more resources – which eventually leads to a fatal OutOfMemoryError.

**2. Heap leaks:**

*(1). Static Field Holding On to the Object Reference:*

*The first scenario that might cause a Java memory leak is referencing a heavy object with a static field. Therefore,
to prevent such kind of memory leaks, we need to pay close attention to our usage of static; declaring any collection or heavy object as static ties its lifecycle to the lifecycle of the JVM itself,
and makes the entire object graph impossible to collect. We also need to be aware of collections in general – that’s a common way to unintentionally hold on to references for longer than we need to.*

(2). * Calling String.intern() on long String.*

Frequently causes memory leaks involves String operations – specifically the String.intern() API.
The intern API will place the str String in the JVM memory pool – where it can’t be collected – and again, this will cause the GC to be unable to free up enough memory.
The lucky thing is Java 8 already has a solution for this: where the PermGen space is replaced by the Metaspace – which won’t lead to any OutOfMemoryError when using intern on Strings.

(3). *Unclosed Streams, unclosed connections *

Forgetting to close a stream is a very common scenario, and certainly, one that most developers can relate to.
The problem was partially removed in Java 7 when the ability to automatically close all types of streams was introduced into the try-with-resource clause.
Unclosed connections is similar to the unclosed Streams, with the primary difference of dealing with unclosed connections (e.g. to a database, to an FTP server, etc.).
Again, improper implementation can do a lot of harm, leading to memory problems. Therefore, to prevent such kind of memory leaks, we need to always close connections in a disciplined manner.

(4). *Objects without correctly overriding hashCode() and equals().*

A simple but very common example that can lead to a memory leak is to use a HashSet with objects that are missing their hashCode() or equals() implementations.
Specifically, when we start adding duplicate objects into a Set – this will only ever grow, instead of ignoring duplicates as it should. We also won’t be able
to remove these objects, once added.

In these situations, the solution is simple – it’s crucial to provide the hashCode() and equals() implementations.
One tool worth mentioning here is Project Lombok – this provides a lot of default implementation by annotations, e.g. @EqualsAndHashCode.
